								<h2>The gladiators </h2>

							<p>A gladiator  was an armed combatant who entertained audiences in the Roman Republic and Roman Empire in violent confrontations with other gladiators, wild animals, and condemned criminals. Some gladiators were volunteers who risked their lives and their legal and social standing by appearing in the arena. Most were despised as slaves, schooled under harsh conditions, socially marginalized, and segregated even in death. </p>

							<p>Irrespective of their origin, gladiators offered spectators an example of Rome's martial ethics and, in fighting or dying well, they could inspire admiration and popular acclaim. They were celebrated in high and low art, and their value as entertainers was commemorated in precious and commonplace objects throughout the Roman world.</p>
							
							<blockquote>The origin of gladiatorial combat is open to debate. There is evidence of it in funeral rites during the Punic Wars of the 3rd century BC, and thereafter it rapidly became an essential feature of politics and social life in the Roman world. Its popularity led to its use in ever more lavish and costly games.</blockquote>
							

							

				            <p>This shows the life of one such gladiator.</p>

								<h2>The power of the roman emperor</h2>
							</a>
							
							<img class="img-responsive img-rounded" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/Statue-Augustus.jpg">

							<p>The Roman emperor was the ruler of the Roman Empire during the imperial period (starting with the granting of the title augustus to Octavian in 27 BC). The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history. Often when a given Roman is described as becoming "emperor" in English it reflects his taking of the title augustus (and later basileus). Another title often used was caesar, used for heirs-apparent, and imperator, originally a military honorific. Early emperors also used the title princeps civitatis ('first citizen'). Emperors frequently amassed republican titles, notably princeps senatus, consul, and pontifex maximus..</p>

							<h3>The Byzantine emperors.</h3>

							<p>Eastern emperors in Constantinople had been recognized and accepted as Roman emperors both in the East, which they ruled, and by the papacy and Germanic kingdoms of the West until the deposition of Constantine VI and accession of Irene of Athens as Empress regnant in 797. Objecting to a woman ruling the Roman Empire in her own right and issues with the eastern clergy, the Papacy would then create a rival lineage of Roman emperors in western Europe, the Holy Roman Emperors, which ruled the Holy Roman Empire for most of the period between 800 and 1806. These emperors were never recognized as Roman emperors by the court in Constantinople and their coronations resulted in the medieval problem of two emperors..</p>

								<h2>Women make us better - TWEET & Instagram</h2>

							<p>For this year's International Women in Engineering Day, which is held annually on June 23 by the Women’s Engineering Society in the UK with Patronage from UNESCO, we highlight the need for more women to pursue Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) careers by reflecting on the challenges women have historically faced seeking higher education in these areas and promoting paths to success for the next generation of female innovators.</p>

							<p>Our <strong>#WomenMakeUsBetter</strong> video features Boeing engineers reading and reacting to the college rejection letters women received in the early years of the 20th century. While we’ve come a long way since that time, we believe there is still much more to be done to increase the number of women in engineering.</p>
